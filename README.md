# gofolio
Very custom-tailored command line tool that generates markdown files with proper metadata from a dropbox directory with portfolio pictures

Why
===
I've had to change my portfolio image links a few times already and since I'm statically generating markdown for each, it's a bit annoying to have to do that manually. And there's also the part that I don't trust myself to not make mistakes and forget some when I'm doing that myself. 

Having a tool that generates the markdown also means that I can potentially change the tool to read images from a new source if I ever have to change where I'm hosting my images.
